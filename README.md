Quill
=====

Quill is a PDF to epub converter, and epub editor. It runs inside the Beacon
shell to become the "Plume" product.

Installation
============
1. Clone Quill
2. Run `npm install` inside of quill
3. Build a Development build of Quill (See Lumieres Repository).


Contributing
============
- Run `npm run lint` on your code to ensure it conforms to Quill standards

- Make sure all commit messages follow the 50 character subject/72 character
body [formatting used throughout git](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)

- Make sure commit messages start with uppercase present tense commands
e.g. Prefer "Clear selection when clicking templateExplorer" over
"Cleared selection when clicking templateExplorer"

- When adding or updating dependencies list the EXACT version of the dependency
to minimize differences when building at different times.
i.e. treat package.json as a shrinkwrapped dependency specifier
